# pdf-crawler
Our current pdf thing is a phantomjs server to run on our js heavy site. This is something else. 

This tool is a temporary piece for me to quickly move a few hundred thousand old html reports into the current system. This is just the scraping piece and won't link pdf documents with existing data cause we don't have that yet. 

Node based. html-pdf, pdftk, aws, mysql.
